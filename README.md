"Foundations of Imperative Programming" is a course at Carleton University that provides students with a comprehensive introduction to imperative programming languages.

The course achieves this by teaching students how to design and implement small-scale programs using the C language and helping them develop foundational knowledge to learn new languages by themselves.

This repository contains problems from the lab sessions and the solutions to them, acting strictly as a reference for other students. Students taking the course in the current semester should make sure they abide by the [academic integrity policy](https://carleton.ca/engineering-design/current-students/fed-academic-integrity/) before they use this repository for any help.

Note that the solutions are strictly my own, meaning any case of bad practice is my sole responsibility, and not of any professor or teaching assistant.
