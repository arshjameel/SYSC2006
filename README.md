Foundations of Imperative Programming is a course at Carleton University that provides students with a comprehensive introduction to imperative programming languages. 

The course achieves this by teaching students how to design and implement small-scale programs using the C language and helping them develop foundational knowledge to learn new languages by themselves.

This repository contains problems from the lab sessions and the solutions to them. Note that the solutions are strictly my own, meaning any case of bad practice is my sole responsibility, and not of any professor or teaching assistant. 

The purpose of this repository is to help other people refine their programming skills, whether or not they are students of Carleton University.
