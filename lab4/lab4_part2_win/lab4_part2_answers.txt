1. variable1 is a global variable.

2. variable1 is a local variable in lab4test.c and a global variable in main.c. therefore no, they are not the same.

3. No, it does not modify the value of variable1 inside main.c.

4. there are two distinct variables in main.c: variable1 (global) and i (local).

5. there is only one distinct variable1 in main.c and it is global.

6. No, the variable in test1 is not the same as the variable in test2 as they are both local variables.
